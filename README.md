# Jaeger Bindings for Python OpenTracing API 

This is a client-side library that can be used to instrument Python apps 
for distributed trace collection, and to send those traces to Jaeger.
See the [OpenTracing Python API](https://github.com/opentracing/opentracing-python)
for additional detail.

## Installation

```bash
apt-get install python-dev
pip install jaeger-client
```

## Getting Started

(under construction)

If your python code is already instrumented for OpenTracing,
you can simply switch to Jaeger's implementation with:

```python
import opentracing
from jaeger_client import Config

if __name__ == "__main__":
  config = Config(config={},  # usually read from some yaml config
                  service_name='your-app-name')
  tracer = config.initialize_tracer()

  with opentracing.tracer.start_span('TestSpan') as span:
    span.log_event('test message', payload={'life': 42})

  tracer.close()  # flush any buffered spans
```

## Configuration

(under construction)

See [Config class](jaeger_client/config.py).

## Debug Traces (Forced Sampling)

### Programmatically

The OpenTracing API defines a `sampling.priority` standard tag that
can be used to affect the sampling of a span and its children:

```python
from opentracing.ext import tags as ext_tags

span.set_tag(ext_tags.SAMPLING_PRIORITY, 1)
```

### Via HTTP Headers

Jaeger Tracer also understands a special HTTP Header `jaeger-debug-id`,
which can be set in the incoming request, e.g.

```sh
curl -H "jaeger-debug-id: some-correlation-id" http://myhost.com
```

When Jaeger sees this header in the request that otherwise has no
tracing context, it ensures that the new trace started for this
request will be sampled in the "debug" mode (meaning it should survive
all downsampling that might happen in the collection pipeline), and
the root span will have a tag as if this statement was executed:

```python
span.set_tag('jaeger-debug-id', 'some-correlation-id')
```

This allows using Jaeger UI to find the trace by this tag.
